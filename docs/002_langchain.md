## Part 2: Practical Implementation

LangChain is a Python framework that simplifies the process of building applications with LLMs. It provides a set of tools and abstractions for common tasks like managing prompts, interacting with LLMs, and building RAG pipelines.

### Live Demo: Building a Simple Chatbot with LangChain

### Typical AI App Architecture

**Component Overview**:

- Frontend: The user interface where the user interacts with the chatbot
- Backend: The server that handles user requests, orchestrates the AI pipeline, and communicates with the LLM
- AI Components:
  - LLM: The core language model (we use GPT-4o-mini)
  - Vector Database: Stores the embeddings of your knowledge base (FAISS)
  - Orchestration Layer (e.g., LangChain): Manages the flow of data and logic in the AI pipeline

**Data Flow**:
Frontend → API Gateway → LLM Service → Vector Database flow

**Production Considerations**:

- Caching layers and rate limiting considerations
- Monitoring and logging touchpoints
- Cost optimization patterns
- Error handling and graceful degradation
