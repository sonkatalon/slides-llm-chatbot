## Part 3: Testing

### Live Demo

- Semantic similarity
- Hallucination detection
- Latency measurement
- Negative testing
- Golden dataset evals

### Other testing considerations

- Pre-built metrics for different use cases: RAGAS, BLEU, ROUGE, etc.
- Human-in-the-loop: Use human evaluators to score the quality of the chatbot's responses
- Prompt robustness: test variations of phrasing
- Edge case testing: empty queries, very long inputs, special characters, PPI information, prompt injections
- Failure modes: timeout, vendor issues, rate limit,
- Regression testing: snapshot evaluation with golden test cases
